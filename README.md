I'm Usman Ali Aslam I make a Project on Topic: Disease, in C++ Language.

Disease Classification System

This project demonstrates a simple disease classification system implemented in C++. It uses object-oriented programming principles to define various types of diseases and their details.

Classes and Structure

-General Class

The General class serves as a base class for diseases, providing attributes such as name, causes, treatment, and symptoms.

-detailofdisease Class

The detailofdisease class inherits from General and represents specific details of a disease, including its causes, treatment, and symptoms.

-Typeofdisease Class

The Typeofdisease class inherits from General and groups together various instances of detailofdisease related to a specific disease type.

-Disease Class

The Disease class is an abstract base class that defines the overall structure of a disease, including its name, description, and types of disease it encompasses (Typeofdisease instances).

-Derived Classes (Flu, Diabetes, Asthma)

Derived classes like Flu, Diabetes, and Asthma implement specific diseases by instantiating Typeofdisease with appropriate detailofdisease instances.

Functionality

Detail Method
Each disease class implements a Detail() method that outputs detailed information about the disease, including its types (Typeofdisease) and their respective details (detailofdisease).


-Main Program

The main() function demonstrates the usage of the disease classes (Flu, Diabetes, Asthma) by creating instances and invoking their Detail() method to display disease information.
